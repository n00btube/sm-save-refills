; Makes save points refill Samus' energy and supplies, like the ship.
;
; Hijacks the save station PLM and uses some free space in that bank ($84), as
; well as any other bank of your choosing.  This *is* the cross-bank version.

; hijack point: reconfigure the save-station PLM instructions. do not edit.
; the original instructions read:
; [8CF1=prompt][B008][B00E=freeze/pose Samus][8C07,2E=saving sound]...
; we overwrite those first 3 words and chain into the hijacked instructions,
; making it have the effect of:
; [B00E][refill_run, repeated until full][8CF1][B008][8C07,2E]...
org $84AFEE
	DW plm_start    ; hijack the "save?" message & posing
	DW plm_run, $B008
	; the hijack will chain the PLMs we overwrote.
	; remaining PLM instructions are used as-is.

; this stub can be moved anywhere in bank $84â€™s free space, and MUST be bank $84.
; the stub needs 31 ($1F) bytes of space.
