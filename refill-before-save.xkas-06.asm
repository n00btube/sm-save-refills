; Makes save points refill Samus' energy and supplies, like the ship.
;
; Compared to v1, it's smoothly animated, and hijacks differently...
; so there are no longer separate versions for the vanilla ROM and for
; Scyzer's load/save patch.

; hijack point: reconfigure the save-station PLM instructions. do not edit.
; the normal instructions go something like:
; [8CF1=prompt][B008][B00E=freeze/pose Samus][8C07,2E=saving sound]...
; we overwrite those first 3 words and chain into the hijacked instructions,
; making it act like
; [B00E][refill_run, repeated until full][8CF1][B008][8C07,2E]...
org $84AFEE
	DW refill_start    ; hijack the "save?" message & posing
	DW refill_run, $B008
	; the hijack will chain the PLMs we overwrote.
	; remaining PLM instructions are used as-is.

; this can be moved anywhere in bank $84â€™s free space, and MUST be bank $84.
; I'm sorry it's so huge, there's a lot to do.
